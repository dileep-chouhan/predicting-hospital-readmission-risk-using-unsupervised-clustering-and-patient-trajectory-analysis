# Predicting Hospital Readmission Risk Using Unsupervised Clustering and Patient Trajectory Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to identify high-risk patient subgroups susceptible to hospital readmission using unsupervised clustering techniques and patient trajectory analysis.  By analyzing patient data, we aim to uncover hidden patterns and develop a model that can predict the likelihood of readmission. This allows for the implementation of targeted interventions to reduce readmission rates, optimize healthcare resource allocation, and improve overall patient outcomes. The analysis involves clustering patients based on relevant features and visualizing their trajectories over time to identify distinct risk profiles.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following Python libraries:

* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn


## How to Run

To run this project, you will first need to install the necessary dependencies.  You can do this by navigating to the project directory in your terminal and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the main analysis script using:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Example Output

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including details about the clustering process (e.g., number of clusters, cluster characteristics), and model performance metrics (if applicable).  Additionally, the project generates several visualization files (e.g., cluster plots, trajectory plots) in the `output` directory, providing a visual representation of the patient subgroups and their readmission risk profiles.  These plots help in understanding the identified patterns and support informed decision-making.  The exact filenames of the output plots may vary.
